# Neural Networks

## Machine-Learning-Based Classifier
Building a machine-learning-based classifier has two parts: training and prediction.
* Training: Feed in a large corpus of data classified correctly
* Prediction: Use it to classify new instances which has not been seen before

The corpus of data is fed into the ML-based classifier. The classifier then 
outputs the prediction (classification). This prediction is then fed back into the
classifier to improve the model's parameters and make better predictions. This feedback 
is returned in the form of a loss function.

"Representation" ML-based systems figure out by themselves what features to pay attention to.
Neural networks are an example of a representation ml-based system.

## What is a Neural Network 
Nerual networks are deep learning algorithms that learn from the input data what features matter.
Neural networks are, in fact, the most common class of deep learning algorithms.

The fundamental building block in any neural network is a __neuron__. The neuron is the active 
learning unit of the network.

The neural network is made up of layers of neurons. Each layer learns something different from
the data. The collective learning is then combined to get the final output.

### Visible Layers 
Where you feed in the data or where the prediction comes out. Essentially, the first and last
layers. Visible layers are the layers you interact with directly.

### Hidden Layers 
Hidden layers are between the visible layers. They are not interacted with directly, but they 
all operate and extract information from the input data.
